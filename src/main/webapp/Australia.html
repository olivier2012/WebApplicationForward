<h3 class="headers">Found: 1840 .Value: Approximately $3.2 million</h3>
<p> While repairing the embankment of the River Ribble in <span class="location"> Cuerdale, near Preston in England</span>, a group of  workmen dug up a lead box.  Inside was one of the biggest hoards of Viking treasure ever foundâ€”more than 8600 items were documented, including  <span class="treasure">silver coins, various bits of jewelry, and silver ingots</span>. Although the majority of the items originated in English Viking kingdoms, some of the treasure was also traced back to other regions, including <b class="location">Scandinavia, Italy, and Byzantium</b>. The treasure was presented to Queen Victoria, and some of it is now on display in the British Museum . The workmen who found it, meanwhile, managed to grab a <i class="treasure">coin</i> each.
