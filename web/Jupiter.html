    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <img src="JupAnim.gif"  />
    <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a 
        mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar 
        System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice 
        giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.
        When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of -2.94, bright enough for its 
        reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky 
        after the Moon and Venus.

    <p id="paraTwo">
        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen <span class="chemistry">(H) </span>with a quarter of its mass being helium <span class="chemistry">(He)</span>, 
though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of 
heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of 
its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around 
the equator).
</p>
<p>The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in 
turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant 
storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. 
Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 67 moons, 
including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, 
has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.   
</p>
    
<p id="paraFour">
    Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer
    and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by 
    the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route
    to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4,2016

<h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
<p>
    Jupiter is composed primarily of <b>gaseous</b> and <b>liquid</b> matter. It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar 
System and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. The average density 
of Jupiter, 1.326 g/cm3, is the second highest of the giant planets, but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.
Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 88�92% hydrogen and 8�12% helium by percent volume of gas molecules. A helium atom 
has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom, so the composition changes when described as the proportion of 
mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, 
with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. 
</p>

<h3 lang="en">Planetary rings</h3>
<p >
Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo,
a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear to be made of dust, rather than ice 
as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. 
Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. 
The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way,
the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring. There is 
also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon
